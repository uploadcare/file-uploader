# uc-blocks: rich web-components for Uploadcare platform integration solutions

<re-htm src="./assets/htm/doc-nav.htm"><re-htm>

## 💎 Core concepts

* All in one place: here, you can find everything you need to build a modern and reliable web application with Uploadcare on board.
* Modern technologies: web components, service workers, wasm, and other cutting edge web standards are ready to show their power.
* Type safety with a JSDoc declaration and TypeScript static analysis.
* Modern ESM-level code sharing.
* Build stage is unnecessary for development: use the code directly in any modern browser or node.js.
* Fast and secure.
* Minimum of external dependencies: security audit is not expensive.
* We are trying to be as close to the native web platform as possible and not force you to use any specific development environment tools.
* Tested by un Uploadcare community.

* [File uploader solutions](./solutions/file-uploader/) - file uploader implementations for the most frequent use cases.
* [Blocks to build your own custom solutions](./blocks/) - build your own integration solutions with the simple HTML and CSS.

## Typescript support

We use [JSDoc type annotations](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro-to-js-ts.html) for TypeScript static analysis support during development. 

Also we provide type definitions ([*.d.ts files](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/dts-from-js.html)) for the TypeScript projects in our packages.

Check the [JSDoc Reference](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html) page in TypeScript official documentation.

All code in this repository works without any additional build process in any modern browser, so you can just open any HTML file in project structure to make it work during development or for the testing purposes. No source maps or rebuilds are needed.

Also, all content (except node_modules) fully accessible at https://uploadcare.github.io/jsdk/ with the same folder structure.
